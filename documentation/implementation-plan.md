# Implementation plan

Date: 2026-09-11
Companion to [design.md](design.md). The design document says what is built and why, this document says in which order, by whom, and how each step is accepted.

## Working method

Each section below is implemented by one agent, checked for bugs by a second agent with fresh eyes, then reviewed by the orchestrator, who either accepts the section or returns it with concrete fix instructions. A section is committed only after acceptance. Nothing is pushed.

Rules that apply to every section:

- Follow [design.md](design.md). When the design is silent, choose the simplest option that keeps the design's contracts, and write the choice down in the section's notes below.
- Code style is the encoder's: ES modules, Google eslint config, 2 space indent, JSDoc on every public method, private fields with `#`. `npm test` runs lint and mocha and must pass.
- No new runtime dependencies beyond `@point-of-sale/codepage-encoder` and `lean-qr`. Dev dependencies as needed.
- Tests do not need canvas or any native module.
- Every public type is documented with JSDoc typedefs so the bundled declarations are complete.

## Contracts that every section relies on

Bitmap:

```js
{ width: number, height: number, data: Uint8Array }   // 1 bit per pixel, MSB first, rows padded to bytes, 1 = black
```

Render items, see design.md, Output contract:

```js
{ type: 'image', width, height, data }
{ type: 'cut', value: 'full' | 'partial' }
{ type: 'pulse', device: 0 | 1, on: ms, off: ms }
{ type: 'feed', height }
{ type: 'unknown', data: Uint8Array }
```

Renderer classes:

```js
class EscPosRenderer {
  static language = 'esc-pos';
  constructor(options)          // see design.md, Renderer options
  render(bytes) → RenderItem[]  // bytes: Uint8Array or number[]
}
class StarPrntRenderer   // same, language 'star-prnt'
```

Painter interface, internal, used by both parsers:

```js
painter.text(string)                       // append cells in the current style, wraps at the print width
painter.style({ bold, underline, invert, width, height })   // partial updates, underline is 0, 1 or 2
painter.font('A' | 'B')
painter.align('left' | 'center' | 'right')
painter.lineFeed()                         // commit the line, advance by max(line spacing, tallest cell)
painter.lineSpacing(dots)                  // null restores the profile default
painter.strip(bitmap)                      // an inline block in the current line, for column images
painter.block(bitmap)                      // commit the pending line, then a block aligned on its own line
painter.barcode({ symbology, data, moduleWidth, height, hri })
painter.qrcode({ data, moduleSize, errorLevel })
painter.command(item)                      // cut, pulse, unknown: flush per the design, then emit or fall back
painter.reset()                            // initialize
painter.end() → RenderItem[]               // flush everything, return the items, reset
```

## Section 1: bootstrap, font and bitmap

Deliverables:

- `npm install` with the dev dependencies of the encoder minus canvas, plus `@point-of-sale/receipt-printer-encoder` as a dev dependency for fixtures. A `.mocharc` if needed.
- Spleen 12x24 and 8x16 BDF sources in `data/fonts` with the Spleen licence file. Fetch the release tarball from the Spleen GitHub releases.
- `tools/generate.js` packs the fonts into `generated/fonts.js`. Only glyphs for code points that occur in any codepage table of the codepage encoder are included, plus U+FFFD as the fallback glyph if Spleen has it, otherwise a generated hollow box. Store each font as a base64 string of glyph rows plus an index from code point to glyph number, so the generated file stays small. Document the packed format in the tool.
- `src/bitmap.js`: create, get and set pixel, blit a bitmap into another at an offset with OR, extract rows, pack from an array of row bitmasks, split into chunks of a maximum height, trim trailing white bytes of a row.
- `src/font.js`: load a packed font, look up a glyph by code point with the fallback, render a glyph into a cell of a given width and height with integer scaling, bold overstrike, underline thickness and invert.
- `src/formats/pbm.js` and `src/formats/image-data.js`.
- Tests: bitmap operations, font lookup and fallback, one glyph rendered and compared with ASCII art, PBM header and body.

Acceptance:

- `npm test` passes, `npm run generate` regenerates the fonts deterministically.
- `generated/fonts.js` is under 200 kB.
- A test prints the letter A from the 12x24 font as ASCII art and it looks like an A.

## Section 2: painter and ESC/POS text

Deliverables:

- `src/painter.js` per the interface above and the design's Painter section: cells, line height, alignment at commit, wrapping, blank row tracking, feed items, `maxHeight` splitting, the fallback table for unsupported commands, and `end()`.
- `src/renderers/esc-pos.js`: table driven parser for the text, control and style commands in the design's ESC/POS table. Blocks are parsed and skipped in this section with a TODO, so that the stream stays in sync. Unknown commands are skipped by the argument lengths of the ESC/POS specification and produce `unknown` items when supported.
- Codepage decoding through the generated mapping and `CodepageEncoder.getCodepoints`.
- `src/receipt-printer-renderer.js` exports `EscPosRenderer`, `toPbm`, `toImageData`.
- Fixtures: `test/fixtures/esc-pos/<name>.bin` and `<name>.pbm`, produced by a script `test/tools/make-fixtures.js` that runs the encoder. Fixture names: text, styles, sizes, fonts, alignment, table, box, rule, wrap, codepages, cut, pulse, feed. The expected PBM files are generated once by the renderer and then reviewed by eye as ASCII art, after which they are golden.
- A test helper that renders a bitmap as ASCII art and shows a diff on failure.

Acceptance:

- All fixtures render and match.
- The ASCII art of the table and box fixtures shows straight column edges and closed boxes.
- A stream with an unknown command still renders the text after it.
- Cut and pulse items appear where the encoder put them, and disappear when not in `commands`.

## Section 3: StarPRNT and parity

Deliverables:

- `src/renderers/star-prnt.js` per the design's StarPRNT table, text and styles, blocks skipped as in section 2.
- The `star` profile in use, 32 dot line spacing and 9x24 font B.
- Export `StarPrntRenderer`.
- Fixtures for `star-prnt` as in section 2, produced from the same receipts.
- Parity test: for every fixture receipt, render the ESC/POS and the StarPRNT bytes with the same profile and compare the bitmaps.

Acceptance:

- Parity holds for every fixture. Where it cannot, the notes explain the reason and the test lists the exception explicitly.

## Section 4: blocks

Deliverables:

- ESC/POS column images `ESC *` with `ESC 3` line spacing, raster images `GS v 0`, Star column images `ESC X`.
- QR codes through lean-qr in both parsers, with model, module size and error level.
- One-dimensional barcodes in `src/symbologies`: UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-13, EAN-8, Code 39, ITF, Codabar, Code 93, Code 128 with the encoder's set selection, GS1-128 and Code 128 auto. Check digit handling as the design describes. HRI text under the bars in font B.
- PDF417 and GS1 DataBar parsed and reported as `unknown`.
- `src/formats/png.js` with CompressionStream and `stitch(items, options)`.
- Fixtures: image-column, image-raster, qrcode, each barcode symbology, hri, and a full receipt combining everything.

Acceptance:

- A QR fixture decodes with a QR reader library in the test, or the matrix matches lean-qr's own output exactly.
- Barcode fixtures are checked against a reference encoder in the test where one exists in the dev dependencies, otherwise against hand-verified patterns for a short value.
- The full receipt renders in both languages with parity.

## Section 5: build, types and documentation

Deliverables:

- `npm run build` produces the four bundles and the declaration file, the declarations name every export and typedef.
- `documentation/usage.md` in the style of the encoder's documentation: installation, constructing a renderer, the item stream, the helpers, and a preview example.
- README updated to link the documentation.
- `examples/preview.html` that loads the UMD build, encodes a receipt with the encoder from a CDN, renders it and shows it on a canvas.

Acceptance:

- The build runs clean, the example works in a browser according to the implementer's own check, and the declaration file compiles in a TypeScript smoke test.

## Section 6: WebUSBReceiptPrinter, branch tsp100

The repository is cloned into `/Users/salonhub/Projects/Dependencies/WebUSBReceiptPrinter` from GitHub, and the work happens on a branch `tsp100`.

Deliverables, per design.md:

- Constructor options `renderer` and `rendererOptions`.
- `graphics` section on the Star profile for the `star-graphics` language: width 576, commands cut, pulse and feed, wrapper `star-raster`.
- `src/wrappers/star-raster.js` implementing the wrapper exactly as the design's Star raster wrapper section specifies, with the segment lookahead.
- Connected event with the renderer's language, its mapping and columns. Throw without a renderer on a graphics printer.
- `print` renders and wraps for graphics printers, unchanged for others.
- Optional peer dependency on the renderer package.
- Tests for the wrapper: given an item list, the exact byte sequence. The driver repository has no test setup, add mocha.
- README section on the TSP100 and the renderer option.

Acceptance:

- Wrapper tests cover: one image then a partial cut, image then pulse then image then full cut, feed items, an all white row, an image ending without a cut. Byte sequences are checked by the orchestrator against the specification.

## Section 7: WebBluetoothReceiptPrinter, branch meow

Work on a branch `meow` in the existing checkout.

Deliverables, per design.md:

- Same option contract as section 6.
- `graphics` section on the cat printer profile, wrapper `meow`, `maxHeight` 256.
- `src/wrappers/meow.js`: packet builder with CRC8, the job sequence, row bit reversal, feed for feed items and at the end, and pause and resume handling from the notify characteristic.
- Passthrough for the `meow` language removed, connect throws without a renderer. Major version bump.
- Tests for the packet builder and the job sequence.
- README section.

Acceptance:

- Packet tests match the byte layouts in the design, including CRC values checked by hand for one packet.

## Section 8: NetworkReceiptPrinter

- Same option contract, plus a `model` or `language` option since the socket has no identity. The Star raster wrapper copied from section 6.
- README section noting that this is untested on hardware.

## Notes per section

Filled in during implementation.

### Section 1

Choices made where the design was silent:

- **Spleen 2.2.0** is the font release in `data/fonts`, with its BSD licence. Neither size has U+FFFD, so the fallback glyph is the hollow box that `tools/generate.js` draws, inset one dot horizontally and `round(height / 6)` from the top and `round(height / 4)` from the bottom, which puts it in the ink area of the other glyphs.
- The packed format is `{width, height, fallback, index, data}` per font, keyed by cell size, `12x24` and `8x16`. `index` maps a code point to a glyph number, `data` is base64 of all glyphs, a glyph being `height` rows of `Math.ceil(width / 8)` bytes, so a glyph is a Bitmap without copying. Glyph 0 is the fallback. The union of the codepage tables plus ASCII 0x20 to 0x7E gives 527 glyphs per font, together 55 kB.
- Spleen 12x24 has no glyph for 46 of the code points of cp437, the Greek and mathematical tail, the house, the peseta sign and the florin among them. Font A borrows those from Spleen 8x16, centred in the 12x24 cell, instead of printing fallback boxes. The `borrow` field of the font list in the tool says which font borrows from which.
- `Bitmap` is a class of static methods on plain `{width, height, data}` objects, so that a bitmap stays exactly the data the output contract describes.
- `Bitmap.packRows` takes numbers for widths up to 32 dots and bigints for any width, and throws when a number is given for a wider row.
- `Bitmap.trimRow` returns a view on the bitmap, not a copy, except for a bitmap without width, which has no row to view and gets one white byte. `Bitmap.split` returns the bitmap itself when it already fits.
- `Font.renderGlyph` centres the glyph in the cell, horizontally and vertically, so that an 8x16 glyph sits in the middle of a 9x24 cell. Bold overstrikes before scaling, as a printer does, the underline is drawn after scaling and stays one or two dots thick, and inverting is last. An inverted cell is not underlined, which is what the ESC/POS reference of `ESC - n` says.
- Box drawing characters have to connect across cells, which the gap between a glyph and a larger cell breaks. `renderGlyph` takes a `stretch` option that pulls the ink at the edges of the glyph out to the edges of the cell before scaling, and `Font.isBoxDrawing(codepoint)` says for which code points the painter passes it, U+2500 to U+259F.
- The glyph index gets a null prototype, so that a code point never finds a property of `Object`, and `Font.get` decodes each built in font once per process.
- `toImageData` takes the ImageData constructor as a second argument when the platform has no global one.
